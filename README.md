# Flask Website Template
This is the base template to build a flask app quickly using Docker. This website is developed using Bootstrap for the frontend and Flask for the backend.

To start the website, `cd` to the location of the folder then run:

    # Run this when the first time you run the site
    docker-compose up --build
    
    # Run this the next time you run the site
    docker-compose up
